# React with JSX Assignment

## Overview

This assignment demonstrates the basics of using JSX with React and the role of Babel in compiling JSX.

## Files

- `index.html`: The HTML file including React, ReactDOM, and Babel libraries.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file containing JSX code.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Reflections

- **JSX Syntax**: Makes it easier to write and understand the structure of React components.
- **Babel Compilation**: Transforms JSX into regular JavaScript, ensuring browser compatibility.
- **Declarative UI**: React's declarative approach, combined with JSX, simplifies UI development and maintenance.
